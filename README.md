It seems like you've built quite a comprehensive application using Tkinter for GUI, OpenCV for image and video processing, MediaPipe for pose detection, and Pandas for data manipulation. Here's a brief overview of what your application does:

Cricket Shot Classification: Allows users to upload an image of a cricket shot, and using MediaPipe Pose, it classifies the shot based on the pose of the player in the image.

Research Visualization: Displays selfie segmentation and pose estimation on a given image.

Cricket Match Information: Retrieves data about ongoing cricket matches from an API and displays it in a table using Pandas and PandasTable.

Skeleton Visualization: Allows users to upload a video, and using MediaPipe Pose, it visualizes the skeleton of the person in the video.

Video Analysis: Similar to the skeleton visualization, but here it analyzes a video for specific cricket shots like drive, pull, or leg glance/flick.

This is quite impressive! Do you have any spec
